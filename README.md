1. Compute for each variable ((CS Score, Research Overhead, Admin Base Pay, Tuition)) its
sample mean, variance and standard deviation.
Related variables: mu1, mu2, mu3, mu4, var1, var2, var3, var4, sigma1, sigma2, sigma3,
sigma4

2. Compute for each pair of variables their covariance and correlation. Show the results in
the form of covariance and correlation matrices. Also make a plot of the pairwise data
showing the label associated with each data point. Which are the most correlated and
least correlated variable pair?
Related variables: covarianceMat, correlationMat
3. Assuming that each variable is normally distributed and that they are independent of each
other, determine the log-likelihood of the data (Use the means and variances computed
earlier to determine the likelihood of each data value.)
Related variables: logLikelihood
4. Using the correlation values construct a Bayesian network which results in a higher loglikelihood
than in 3.
Related variables: BNgraph, BNlogLikelihood
